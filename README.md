# Deep Neural Network Pruning

## Overview
This script, `DNN_Pruning.py`, demonstrates the process of pruning a deep neural network (DNN) using PyTorch. The primary goal of this process is to reduce the size of the neural network while minimizing the impact on its accuracy. Benefits of this approach include reduced storage requirements and potentially lower computational costs, especially for optimized architectures.

## Features
- **Model Pruning**: Implements various techniques to prune a deep neural network.
- **PyTorch Integration**: Uses PyTorch for neural network construction and pruning.
- **Accuracy Preservation**: Focuses on maintaining accuracy post-pruning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Numpy

## Usage
To use this script, you need to have a Python environment with the required libraries installed. Run the script in your Python environment. The script will walk through the steps of pruning a neural network model using PyTorch.

## Methodology
- **Model Construction**: Building a neural network using PyTorch.
- **Pruning Techniques**: Applying various pruning methods to the constructed model.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the impact of pruning on model accuracy and size.
